# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, where a player competes against the computer. The player inputs their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly selects one of the options. The winner is determined based on the traditional rules:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

The game checks for valid input and determines the winner, printing out a result message for each round. In case of an invalid input, the program prompts the player to try again.

This project demonstrates basic Python concepts such as user input handling, random choice generation, and conditional logic.

This Rock, Paper, Scissors game is played against the computer and is implemented in Python. It is a terminal-based game, without a GUI (yet).
